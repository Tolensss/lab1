During Leo DiCaprio's interesting middle period, in between Dishy Curtains Heartthrob Leo and Please May I Have A Crumb Of An Oscar Leo, was Action David Brent Leo. In Blood Diamond he's the mercenary Danny Archer, who's been incarcerated for smuggling diamonds during the Sierra Leone Civil War. He's soon out, though, and on the trail of a gigantic pink diamond along with an American journalist (Jennifer Connolly) and the fisherman who originally found it (Djimon Hounsou). The conclusion feels a little bit Hollywood after the gritty, uncompromising first two acts, but there's a lot to enjoy and DiCaprio shines throughout. Because professionalism is... and that is what he wants.
