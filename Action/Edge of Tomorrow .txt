Despite a depressing Westernisation of its source material – Hiroshi Sakurazaka's nihilistic 2004 novel All You Need Is Kill – Edge of Tomorrow is a fine example of a blockbuster done right. With the ever bankable Tom Cruise starring as a military pen pusher deployed to the frontline against an alien invasion, his inevitable gutting is not the end for this absolute mess of an army major. On the contrary, a cataclysmic event forces him to relive every single day on a loop until the moment of death, causing him to seek out a fellow time jumper in Emily Blunt's steely war hero Rita as they try to break the cycle and save Earth. A time and space saga that's not nearly as confusing as Tenet, but just as enjoyable thanks to solid set pieces and a creature design that's genuinely quite chilling.
