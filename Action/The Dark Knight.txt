The second of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy has a habit of overshadowing the other two, mostly thanks to the scene stealing performance of Heath Ledger as Joker, a role whose legacy is still dominating cinema now. It's also, for our money, the best of the three in terms of the action on display, opening with a thrilling bank robbery scene, closing with a heart-in-mouth shootout, and offering plenty of exploding hospitals and imploding football stadiums along the way. The Dark Knight is a thinking man's action film, with even the absence of an explosion heightening the tension at one point, as in the scene where two ferries full of passengers refuse to blow the other up to save themselves, proving Gotham might have a soul after all.
