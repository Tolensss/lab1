An extraordinarily high concentration of cinema's most intensely odd character actors, including Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich and Steve Buscemi, are dangerous convicts being flown across America. The prisoners hijack the plane and all hell breaks lose. Cage is the actually-very-nice con trying to do the right thing without letting anyone know he's on the feds' side. Glorious stuff.
