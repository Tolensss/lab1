A high concept chase thriller that's so high concept you only need the one word of its title to know what it's all about. Dennis Hopper's put a bomb on a bus, Keanu Reeves isn't having that, Sandra Bullock's behind the wheel keeping the whole thing going above 50mph. It's beautifully put together: just when you think it's out of gas, Speed floors it again.
