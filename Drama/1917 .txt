Sir Sam Mendes' one-shot (yes, yes, it wasn't a proper one-shot) epic, set on the Western Front just as the powers that were prepared to shovel more young men into the mincing machine, absolutely hoovered up Baftas and technical plaudits, as well as cramming in brief hellos from Colin Firth, Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch and Richard Madden. With a little distance, though, it's not the glitz which makes a mark, even if Roger Deakins' cinematography is still remarkable. It's George Mackay's extraordinary, tender, terrified, resolute performance as Schofield, and the small, quiet moments in which the adrenaline drops – a meeting with a mother and child, Schofield drifting along a river – which make it so good.
